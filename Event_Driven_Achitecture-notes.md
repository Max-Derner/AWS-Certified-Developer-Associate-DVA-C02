Event Driven Architectures are
* Event Driven and Asynchronous
    * An event or message may trigger an action but no response is expected or required
* Loosely Coupled
    * SQS allows you to queue messages, and EventBridge helps handle and route them to components
* Flexible and Scalable
    * Services and Components can operate and scale independently
