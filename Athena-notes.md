## What is it?
Lets you run SQL against data in S3.  
You pay per query and don't need to set up complex ETL (Extract Transform Load) processes.  
You must create an additional S3 bucket to store SQL results in.

## Use cases (inexhaustive examples)
* Query log files
* Perform cost analysis
* Generate business reports
* Analyze click-stream data (click-stream data is data about how a user is navigating your website)

## Exam tips
* Interactive query service
* Run your SQL queries on you S3 data
* Serverless (no extra infrastructure beyond the S3 bucket)
